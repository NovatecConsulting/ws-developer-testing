REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===

== Request Headers

There are special headers which can be given as part of a request:

- `X-Correlation-ID` - Override the correlation ID logged by the service for
this request. Used for tracing of requests over multiple services.

== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will
contain a JSON object that describes the problem. For example, a create book
request missing the `isbn` and `title` fields will produce a `400 Bad Request`
response like this:

include::{snippets}/books/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

== Hypermedia

This application uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources
in their responses. Responses are in
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application from resource to resource. Language (HAL)]
format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links
to navigate

== Resources

=== Index

The API index can be retrieved with a GET on `/api`. It provides links to the
resources provided by this service.

include::{snippets}/index/getIndex/http-request.adoc[]

An index response looks something like this:

include::{snippets}/index/getIndex/http-response.adoc[]

=== Books

==== Creating a new Book

In order to create a book, the consumer needs to provide an `isbn` number and
a `title` for the new book and `POST` them to `/api/books`:

include::{snippets}/books/postBook-created/http-request.adoc[]

This will create a new book in the library's collection. The response to this
request will contain the stored data and links to available action resources.

include::{snippets}/books/postBook-created/http-response.adoc[]

==== Updating a Book

In order to update properties of a book, the consumer can `PUT` the new
property value on a corresponding path.

Currently only the following properties can be updated:

- authors
- numberOfPages
- title

===== Authors

The `authors` can be updated with a `PUT` on `/api/books/{bookId}/authors`:

include::{snippets}/books/putBookAuthors-ok/http-request.adoc[]

The data can be removed completely by sending a `DELETE` to the same endpoint
like this:

include::{snippets}/books/deleteBookAuthors-ok/http-request.adoc[]

===== Number of Pages

The `numberOfPages` can be updated with a `PUT` on `/api/books/{bookId}/numberOfPages`:

include::{snippets}/books/putBookNumberOfPages-ok/http-request.adoc[]

The data can be removed completely by sending a `DELETE` to the same endpoint
like this:

include::{snippets}/books/deleteBookNumberOfPages-ok/http-request.adoc[]

===== Title

The `title can be updated with a `PUT` on `/api/books/{bookId}/title`:

include::{snippets}/books/putBookTitle-ok/http-request.adoc[]

==== Listing all existing Books

All existing books of the library's collection can be retrieved with a `GET`
request on the `/api/books` resource:

include::{snippets}/books/getAllBooks-2Books/http-request.adoc[]

If there are any books in the library the response would look something like
this:

include::{snippets}/books/getAllBooks-2Books/http-response.adoc[]

If there are no books in the library the response would be:

include::{snippets}/books/getAllBooks-0Books/http-response.adoc[]

==== Getting a Book

Existing books of the library's collection can be retrieved with a `GET`
request on the book's `/api/books/{id}` resource:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-foundAvailable/http-request.adoc[]

The response can either contain an available book like this:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-foundAvailable/http-response.adoc[]

Or it could contain a borrowed book like this:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-foundBorrowed/http-response.adoc[]

If the requested book doesn't exist a `404 Not Found` is returned like this:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-notFound/http-response.adoc[]

==== Borrowing a Book

In order to borrow a book it has to (1) exist and (2) not already be borrowed
by someone else. A book can be borrowed by providing a `borrower` as part
of a `POST` request on the `/api/books/{id}/borrow` action resource:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-foundAvailable/http-request.adoc[]

If the book was successfully borrowed, the response would be something like
this:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-foundAvailable/http-response.adoc[]

If the book was already borrowed a `409 Conflict` response will be returned:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-foundAlreadyBorrowed/http-response.adoc[]

If the book doesn't exist a `404 Not Found` is returned like this:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-notFound/http-response.adoc[]

==== Returning a Book

In order to return a book it has to (1) exist and (2) be borrowed by someone.
A book can be returned sending an empty `POST` request to the
`/api/books/{id}/return` action resource:

include::{snippets}/books/returnBookById-foundBorrowed/http-request.adoc[]

If the book was successfully returned, the response would be something like
this:

include::{snippets}/books/returnBookById-foundBorrowed/http-response.adoc[]

If the book was already returned a `409 Conflict` response will be returned:

include::{snippets}/books/returnBookById-foundAlreadyReturned/http-response.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/books/returnBookById-notFound/http-response.adoc[]
